# Goal
To make a keychain in the shape of the HyTech logo that can be connected to a USB-C power source and flash 6 LED lights on a 53% duty cycle. The circuit models the Ready-To-Move light used on the car to indicate that high voltage power is connected to the motors. 
## Background/Introduction
Starting this project, I had little experience with PCB design, reading datasheets, soldering, and none at all with Altium Designer. Throughout the project, I learned a lot about the process of designing PCBs, parsing datasheets, and using Altium, to the point where I can comfortably work with these tools and complete similar tasks on my own.
