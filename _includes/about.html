    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a Computer Engineering student at Georgia Tech with a passion for mechanical design, 
        prototyping, and bringing innovative ideas to life. With expertise in CAD modeling, PCB design, 
        and various manufacturing processes, I enjoy tackling complex engineering challenges and 
        creating practical solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I'm not working on projects, you can find me exploring new technologies, refining my 
        skills in 3D modeling and circuit design, or collaborating with fellow engineers to push 
        the boundaries of what's possible.
